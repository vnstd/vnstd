#### Hello, world üëã
  
### Experience

  Since October 2020, I'm involved in the development of several fintech services related to the exchange of crypto and fiat currencies.  
  
My responsibilities include:  
- Development of the front-end part of the projects. Writing and support of complex modules and components, implemented on Vue technology stack;
- Implementation of business logic, new functionality;
- Code refactoring and writing documentation;
- Adaptive SCSS based layout for modern browsers;
  
Prior to my current position, I worked on freelance sites from February 2017 to October 2020. 
I was involved in the layout of internet commerce web pages, improving the performance of web applications, and developing complex components. Took part in migrating a project from JQuery to Vue. Also had experience writing CSS3 animations.

Now, as a pet-project, I am designing and developing my own service for easy management and monitoring of finances.
